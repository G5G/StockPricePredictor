# Stock Price Predictor

This is an upload of my stock price prediction software that I developed during the foundation year of my BSc in computer science.

## About this Project

The stock price predictor was created entirely in C# and utilizes the AlphaVantage API to retrieve historical data from a chosen stock market symbol.
Notably, this project does not rely on any machine learning libraries; it was developed entirely by hand. The project uses the LSTM layer to predict stock prices.
